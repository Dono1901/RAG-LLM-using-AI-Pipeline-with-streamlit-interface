#**RAG & LLM with Pathway to Process Financial Reports and Tables**

**Overview**

This project is for building a system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to process financial reports and tables. The system integrates structured data (e.g., tables) and unstructured data (e.g., text, images) with Claude Sonet 3.5, using Pathway’s Google Drive Connector and Streamlit for the user interface.

**Key Components and Technologies**

**1. Pathway Framework**



* **RAG Pipelines:** Pathway’s efficient pipeline framework is used to build scalable workflows for real-time and batch processing of multimodal data.
* **Google Drive Connector:** Handles real-time data ingestion from Google Drive for seamless integration of financial reports.
* **VectorStore/DocumentStore:** Enables instant access and retrieval of relevant data for analysis.

**2. Claude Sonet 3.5**



* **LLM:** A powerful large language model used for natural language understanding and generation to analyze textual and tabular data.
* **Multimodal Processing:** Handles diverse data formats, enhancing the insights derived from financial reports.

**3. Streamlit**



* **Frontend:** Provides an interactive user interface for visualizing financial data insights and interacting with the system.
