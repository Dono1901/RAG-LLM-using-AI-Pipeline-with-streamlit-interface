Welcome to the **RAG-LLM Using AI Pipeline with Streamlit Interface** repository! This project integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Claude Sonet 3.5 LLM and the Pathway framework to provide insights into financial reports and tables. The system ingests data from Google Drive, processes both structured and unstructured formats in real time, and presents the results through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
